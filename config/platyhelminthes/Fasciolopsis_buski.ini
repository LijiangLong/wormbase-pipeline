study_description=Fasciolopsis buski is a socioeconomically important and one of the largest intestinal flukes of pigs and humans with a flat and thick body of 2-10 cm in length and 0.8-3 cm in width that causes the disease fasciolopsiasis. The infective cysted stages of this flatworm develop on the surface of aquatic plants, eg. Water caltrop and reach their host due to ingestion of such contaminated vegetation. In several countries, this neglected tropical disease is aggravated by factors, such as poverty, malnutrition, and an uncontrolled food market associated with lack of food inspection, poor sanitation, and other helminthiases. Although fasciolopsiasis can be controlled along with other food-borne parasitoses, it still remains a public health problem in many endemic areas including India despite sustained WHO control programmes. The parasite is a close relative of liver flukes (Fasciola). Very little is known about this parasite and its relationship with its hosts at the molecular level. Here, we carried out advanced sequencing and bioinformatic technologies employed to explore the genes transcribed in the adult stage of F. buski.
