study_description=The cestode Schistocephalus solidus has been the focus of extensive research in parasitology for over 250 years and has now become a powerful model for studying host-parasite interactions. S. solidus can be utilized to better understand the complex molecular mechanisms underlying functional changes associated with host transitions. We have sequenced and assembled (de novo) the transcriptome of S. solidus using whole organisms from three key developmental stages involved in host transitions: non infective plerocercoid, infective plerocercoid and adult. Recent publications in parasitology, and more specifically on host-parasite interactions, have been strongly focused towards reviews and development of ideas and theoretical frameworks, but empirical data acquisition is still lagging behind. The main objective underlying the publication of this data is to increase the amount of publicly available resources for host-parasite systems and more specifically for S. solidus. Our de novo assembly pipeline for the transcriptome of Schistocephalus solidus allowed us to reconstruct 24,765 high-confidence, non-redundant transcripts, associated with 10,285 unigenes. This represents the first large-scale transcriptomic dataset to be published for this particular parasite species. Accessibility to high-quality genetic resources for a wide panel of host-parasite systems is fundamental not only to the advancement of knowledge on the mechanisms of host-parasite interactions, but also on the evolution of complex life cycles and parasitism itself.

study_description=Whilst the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and its various macroparasites have become increasingly used to investigate the genetic basis of parasitic evolutionary pressure and its effects on immunocompetence the majority of studies focus on the stickleback. In this study the focus was on Schistocephalus solidus, a tapeworm using the three-spined stickleback as an obligate intermediate host. The aim was to determine particular genes that could be responsible for host manipulation and virulence levels within the fish. Using a fully crossed infection experiment with German and Norwegian populations we confirmed possible virulence optima for sympatric combinations and noticed virulence mismatch between allopatric ones. German worms in Norwegian fish failed to reach this optimum whilst Norwegian worms in German fish seemed to overshoot it and thus overexploit their fish hosts. To identify the genes involved we initially developed the first annotated draft transcriptome library for S. solidus. Then using differential gene expression counts for a select few worms from each combination we identified candidate genes that could be responsible for such mismatches. Finally, we developed primer pairs for 32 selected genes and ran multiplexed RTqPCR on all 92 S. solidus in our experiment using the Fluidigm platform. The combined results including the developing transcriptome library and working primers give us not only an indication of virulence genes that S. solidus uses but also provides a solid platform for future studies on the S. solidus/three-spined stickleback interactome.
