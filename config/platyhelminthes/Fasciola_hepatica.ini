study_description=Fasciola hepatica is a parasitic fluke that lives in the liver. In addition to humans it infects cows and sheep. It is known as the sheep or common liver fluke and causes a disease called fascioliasis. Fasciola hepatica is found in areas where cattle and sheep are raised. Adults reach a length of 3 cm and 1 cm width. Fascioliasis is caused by Fasciola species (F. hepatica and F. gigantica), where infection arises from ingestion of metacercariae on water plants such as watercress. Note that the physical sample for this Fasciola hepatica BioSample (SAMN02780903) was found to contain a Neorickettsial endosymbiont, so the physical sample was assigned a second BioSample accession (SAMN04272095) for the endosymbiont record.
