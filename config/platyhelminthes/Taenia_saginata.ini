study_description=The beef tapeworm, Taenia saginata, is the casual agent of human and bovine cysticercosis. This worm has many similarities with the widely known pork tape worm, Taenia solium, but they act different on the infection procedure. We expect to find out their genomic differences by sequecing and comparing them, and try to find out the key genes that have relations with the infection.
