study_description=Cystic hydatid disease (CHD) is caused by infection with larval stages of the cestode Echinococcus granulosus and affects humans and domestic animals worldwide. Excretory-secretory proteins (ESPs) released by the parasite play an important role in host immune regulation, yet their effects on parasite development and growth remain unclear. we used Roche 454 sequencing technology and in silico secretome analysis to explore the transcriptome profiles of the larval stage of E. granulosus and elucidate the potential role of ESPs in the metabolic adaptation of parasites to their hosts.
