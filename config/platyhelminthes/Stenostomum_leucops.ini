study_description=This is a cDNA sample derived from hundreds of organisms propagated asexually from a single individual identified as Stenostomum leucops, propagated using a crude wheat germ culture. A nonstranded cDNA library was created using the Illumina TruSeq RNA v2 kit, and sequenced in multiplex on a HiSeq 2000 instrument (2x100 bp reads) for the purpose of de novo transcriptome assembly, providing a survey of peptide sequences used to infer phylogenetic relationships within the phylum Platyhelminthes.
