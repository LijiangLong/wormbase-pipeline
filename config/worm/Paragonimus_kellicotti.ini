study_description=Paragonimus spp., the lung flukes, represents one of the most injurious of the food-borne helminths. These flukes cause paragonimiasis in people and other crab-eating mammals in Asia, parts of West Africa, and South and Central America. About 20 million people are infected with lung flukes and an estimated 293 million people are at-risk (Keiser and Utzinger 2009).
