study_description=The collective burden of the common helminth diseases – which range from the dramatic sequelae of elephantiasis and blindness to the more subtle but widespread effects on child development, pregnancy, and productivity – rivals that of the main high-mortality conditions such as HIV/AIDS or malaria. The W.H.O. estimates 2.9 billion people are infected and morbidity from helminthes is substantial and rivals diabetes and lung cancer in worldwide DALY measurements. Despite some advances in drug availability and public health infrastructure, most helminth diseases have remained intractable problems.This study, involving A. viteae and other nematodes, will provide the resources needed to create a comprehensive map of genetic diversity in helminth parasites, so that in the long run, the molecular profiling of human helminthiasis will be improved and the spread of resistance can be monitored and managed.
