study_description=Trichinellosis of human and other mammals was caused through the ingestion of the parasite，Trichinella spiralis，contaminated meat. It is a typical zoonotic disease that affects more than 10 million people world-wide. Parasites of Trichinella genus are unique intracellular pathogens. Adult Trichinella parasites directly release newborn larvae which invade striated muscle cells and causes diseases. In this study, we profiled the global transcriptome in the three developmental stages of T. spiralis. The transcriptomic analysis revealed the global gene expression patterns from newborn larval stage through muscle larval stage to adults. Thousands of genes with stage-specific transcriptional patterns were described and novel genes involving host-parasite interaction were identified. More than 45% of the protein-coding genes showed evidence of transcription from both sense and antisense strands which suggests the importance of RNA-mediated gene regulation in the parasite. This study presents a first deep analysis of the transcriptome of T. spiralis, providing insight information of the parasite biology. Overall design: Messenger RNA from three developmental stages of T. spiralis was selectively purified from total RNA using oligo-(dT) conjugated magnetic beads. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized guided by oligo-(dT) as a primer.

study_description=We present the first study to confirm the existence of  DNA  methylation  in  the  parasitic  nematode  Trichinella  spiralis,  and  we characterize  the  methylomes  of  the  three  life-cycle  stages  of  this  food-borne infectious human pathogen. We observe a drastic increase in DNA methylation during the  transition  from  the  new  born  to  mature  stage,  and  we  further  identify parasitism-related  genes  that  show  changes  in  DNA  methylation  status  between  life cycle stages. We also evaluated differential gene expression among  the three life stages using  Illumina HiSeq 2000 RNA-seq technology. Overall design: Examination of DNA methylation status and gene expression status in three life stages (Adult, muscle larvae, newborn larvae) of Trchinella Spiralis using MethylC-seq.
