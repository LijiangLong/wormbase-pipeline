study_description=This data is part of a pre-publication release. For information on the proper use of pre-publication data shared by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (including details of any publication moratoria), please see http://www.sanger.ac.uk/datasharing/ Teladorsagia circumcincta, the brown stomach worm, is the most important gastro-intestinal parasite of sheep in temperate regions and is present on 100% of sheep farms in the UK. Infection with T. circumcincta causes a spectrum of disease in the host, ranging from weight loss to death, and results in significant production losses. Parasitic disease is currently controlled by treatment with anthelmintics but resistance to these drugs is widespread and threatens the viability of the livestock industry. There are now well-documented cases of UK farms harbouring ‘triple-resistant’ T. circumcincta, which can no longer be controlled by any of the three major anthelmintic classes, forcing farmers to abandon sheep rearing. High-throughput sequencing of life stages of T. circumcincta will be used for gene finding and transcriptome analysis.

study_description=The Genome Institute and collaborators are sequencing the brown stomach worm, Teladorsagia circumcinta (aka Ostertagia circumcincta). This is economically the most important parasite of sheep throughout temperate regions of the world and has developed multiple resistances to drugs. Globally, these parasites lead to millions of dollars in economic losses due to low production of meat, wool and milk and the high costs of treatment.  These brownish, thread-like worms infect the gastric glands of the stomach in small ruminants (sheep and goats), causing weight loss, decreased wool production and death.   Sequencing T. circumcincta will aid in vaccine development and the study of the immune response in this host-parasite system. A vaccine against T. cicumcincta would reduce economic losses associated with infection, particularly in regions where multiple-drug resistant strains exist.

study_description=RNA was extracted from 100,000 exsheathed 3rd larval stage Teladorsagia                circumcincta exposed to either a naïve or immune host (ovine) abomasal environment,                then cDNA synthesised using the CLONTECH SMARTerTM cDNA synthesis protocol. The cDNA                was sequenced on the Roche 454 titanium platform. The resulting reads were assembled                using Roche Newbler assembler v2.5 and BLAST mapped to NCBI the non-redundant                protein dataset. The assembled Isotigs were clustered using UCLUST v3.0.617, and the                relative abundance of the cluster in each dataset determined by analysis of read                counts. Gene Ontology and KEGG biological pathway annotation of the Isotig                representative sequences was also carried out.

study_description=Helminth infections are estimated to have a disease burden equivalent to 25% of that of HIV/AIDS and 50% of that of malaria. In recognition of the enormous health burden caused by these helminth parasites there is now an unprecedented effort, based on mass drug administration of very few anthelmintic drugs, to control these infections. However, reinfection after drug therapy is common and anthelmintic resistance is emerging and spreading as a problem. Genomes of drug resistant isolates will provide the world community of helminth researchers with the resources needed to create a comprehensive map of genetic diversity in a model parasite and allow the utilization of this information in similar studies involving parasites of importance in humans. In the long run, the expected outcome will enable the potential mechanisms of resistance in human parasites to be correctly understood and genetic markers to be identified so that the development and spread of resistance can be monitored and managed.
