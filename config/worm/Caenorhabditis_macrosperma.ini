study_description=DNA and RNA were isolated from Caenorhabditis macrosperma at the Félix lab in Paris. Two genomic libraries of differing insert-size were prepared by Edinburgh Genomics and each was sequenced twice as paired-end using Illumina HiSeq 2500. Three PE runs of RNA-seq data were also generated. Caenorhabditis macrosperma genome sequencing is part of the collaborative Caenorhabditis Genomes Project. Edinburgh Genomics was carried out the sequencing using Illumina platforms. Visit caenorhabditis.bio.ed.ac.uk to browse genome assemblies, download “cleaned” reads and find out more.
