study_description=This is a cDNA library prepared from a mixed sample of multiple adults and developing embryos/larvae at various stages of development pooled prior to RNA extraction. The cDNA libraries were non-stranded, and sequenced 2x100 bp in multiplex with 5 other libraries on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. More specimen accession data is available at MCZbase under IZ26518/IZ26521.
