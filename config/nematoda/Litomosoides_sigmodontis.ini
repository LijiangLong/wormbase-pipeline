study_description=In mammalian systems, extracellular small RNAs can operate in a paracrine manner to communicate information between cells, relying on transport within vesicles. “Foreign” small RNAs derived from bacteria, plants and parasites have also been detected in mammalian body fluids, sparking interest in whether these could mediate inter-species communication. However, there is no mechanistic framework for RNA-mediated interspecies communication and the active movement of RNA via vesicles has not been shown outside of mammals. Here we demonstrate that specific microRNAs and Y RNAs are packaged into vesicles secreted by a gastrointestinal nematode, Heligmosomoides polygyrus, which naturally infects mice. Overall design: Total RNA was extracted from the serum of mice infected with Litomosoides sigmodontis at 60 days post infection

study_description=cDNA from three life-stages of the filarial nematode Litomosoides sigmodontis were obtained and sequenced using 454 FLX and Titanium chemistries. These reads are being used to generate a protein set that will be used for annotating the litomsoides sigmodontis genome, and to act as a reference transcriptome for further transcriptome studies using short read RNA-seq.
