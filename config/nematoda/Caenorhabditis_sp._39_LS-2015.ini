study_description=DNA and RNA were isolated from Caenorhabditis sp. 39 at the Braendle Lab in Nice. Three sets of PE reads of insert size 350 were sequenced by Edinburgh Genomics, along with two sets of PE reads of insert size 550. Two sets of a PE RNA-seq reads were also generated. Caenorhabditis sp. 39 genome sequencing is part of the collaborative Caenorhabditis Genomes Project. Edinburgh Genomics was carried out the sequencing using Illumina platforms.
