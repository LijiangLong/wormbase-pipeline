study_description=RNA derived from a combination of all motile stages was sequenced to study genes expressed during invasion of host tissues. These would include genes involved in locomotion, structural integrity of the cuticle and those encoding peptides that may aid parasitism. The data will allow Nematologists to explore differences in potential effectors/genes in root lesion nematodes compared to those present in root knot and cyst nematodes (e. g. those thought to be involved in host feeding site development), and those that are common to these different nematode genera (e.g. those involved in plant cell wall modification).
