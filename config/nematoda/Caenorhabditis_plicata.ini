study_description=Note: we know there to be a significant amount of bacterial contamination in these sequence files. The genome also appears to have a significant amount of heterozygosity. DNA and RNA were isolated from Caenorhabditis plicata at the Félix lab in Paris.  Two genomic libraries of differing insert-size were prepared by Edinburgh Genomics and each was sequenced as paired-end using Illumina HiSeq 2500. Another genomic library was also prepared and sequenced as paired-end using Illumina MiSeq. A single PE run of RNA-seq data was also generated. Caenorhabditis plicata genome sequencing is part of the collaborative Caenorhabditis Genomes Project. Edinburgh Genomics was carried out the sequencing using Illumina platforms.
