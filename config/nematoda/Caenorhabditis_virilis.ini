study_description=DNA and RNA were isolated from Caenorhabditis virilis at the Félix lab in Paris. Two genomic libraries of differing insert-size were prepared by Edinburgh Genomics and each was sequenced three times as  paired-end using Illumina HiSeq 2500. A single PE run of RNA-seq data was also generated. Caenorhabditis virilis genome sequencing is part of the collaborative Caenorhabditis Genomes Project. Edinburgh Genomics was carried out the sequencing using Illumina platforms. Visit caenorhabditis.bio.ed.ac.uk to browse genome assemblies, download “cleaned” reads and find out more.
