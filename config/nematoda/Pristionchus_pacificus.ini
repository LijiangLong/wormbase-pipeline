study_description=Discovery of trans-splicing in multiple metazoan lineages led to the identification of operon-like gene organization in diverse organisms including trypanosomes, tunicates and nematodes, but the functional significance of such operons is not completely understood. To see whether the content or organization of operons serves similar roles across species, we experimentally defined operons in the nematode model Pristionchus pacificus.

study_title=Male and Female DNA and RNA sequencing in several nematode species
center_name=GEO
tax_id=54126
study_description=The overall goal of this investigation was to investigate X-content of sex-biased genes in several nematode species. The following species of nematode were investigated: *C. elegans, *N2; *C. brenneri, *PB2801; *C. briggsae, *AF16; *C. remanei*, PB4641; *P. **pacificus, *PS312*.*  Genomic DNA sequencing data was used to assign X and autosomal - linkage to unassembled sequencing contigs.  Male and female RNA seq data was then generated and used to determine sex-biased expression. For both DNA and RNA experiments,  50bp paired-end (DNA) or single-end (RNA) reads were generated on the Illumina HiSeq 2500. Sequencing lanes were multiplexed. Genomic DNA was isolated from 50-100 hand-picked young adult worms. At least two replicates for each sex were prepared. DNA was sheared via sonication and 350-500 bp sequencing libraries were prepared following the Illumina protocol. Total RNA was isolated from at least 1000 hand-picked L4/young adult worms (*C. **elegans, *N2) or J4/young adult worms (*P. pacificus, *PS312*). *PolyA beads were used to enrich for mRNA. Stranded RNAseq libraries were prepared via incorporation of dUTPs during cDNA synthesis, following the protocol detailed in Parkhomchuk et al, 2009. DNAseq and RNAseq reads were aligned to the appropriate WS228 reference genomes. Overall design: DNA sequencing data (2-3 replicates) from male and female YA worms are included along with RNAseq data from C.elegans YA hermaphrodites and P.pacificus YA males and hermaphrodites.

study_title=Microevolution of duplications and deletions and their impact on gene expression in the nematode Pristionchus pacificus
center_name=MAX PLANCK INSTITUTE FOR DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
tax_id=54126
study_description=The evolution of diversity across the animal kingdom has been accompanied by tremendous gene loss and gain. While comparative genomics has been fruitful to characterize differences in gene content across highly diverged species, little is known about the microevolution of structural variations that cause these differences in the first place. In order to investigate the genomic impact of structural variations, we made use of genomic and transcriptomic data from the nematode Pristionchus pacificus, which has been established as a satellite model to the well studied nematode model Caenorhabditis elegans for comparative biology. We exploit the fact that P. pacificus is a highly diverse species for which various genomic data including the draft genome of a sister species P. exspectatus is available. Based on resequencing coverage data for two natural isolates we identified large (> 2kb) deletions and duplications relative to the reference strain. By restriction to completely syntenic regions between P. pacificus and P. exspectatus, we were able to polarize the comparison and to assess the impact of structural variations on expression levels. We found that while loss of genes correlates with lack of expression, duplication of genes has virtually no effect on gene expression. Further investigating allelic ratios of sites that segregate between the duplicate copies, we found in the majority of cases only one of the alleles to be expressed, suggesting that one of the copies lacks functionality. Nevertheless, we still find that certain gene classes are strongly depleted in deletions as well as duplications, suggesting an evolutionary constraint acting on synteny. In summary, our results are consistent with a model, where most structural variations are either deleterious or non-functional and provide first insights into the microevolution of structural variations in the P. pacificus genome.

study_title=microRNAs in C. elegans, P. pacificus, and S. ratti: Conserved miRNAs are candidate post-transcriptional regulators of developmental arrest in free-living and parasitic nematodes
center_name=GEO
tax_id=54126
study_description=Animal development is complex yet surprisingly robust. Animals may develop alternative phenotypes conditional on environmental changes. Under unfavorable conditions C. elegans larvae enter the dauer stage, a developmentally arrested, long-lived, and stress-resistant state. Dauer larvae of free-living nematodes and infective larvae of parasitic nematodes share many traits including a conserved endocrine signaling module (DA/DAF-12), which is essential for the formation of dauer and infective larvae. We speculated that conserved post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism might also be involved in executing the dauer and infective larvae fate. We used an unbiased sequencing strategy to characterize the microRNA (miRNA) gene complement in C. elegans, P. pacificus, and S. ratti. Our study raised the number of described miRNA genes to 257 for C. elegans, tripled the known gene set for P. pacificus to 362 miRNAs and is the first to describe miRNAs in a Strongyloides parasite. Moreover, we found a limited core set of 24 conserved miRNA families in all three species. Interestingly, our estimated expression fold changes between dauer vs. non-dauer stages and infective larvae vs. free-living stages reveal that despite the speed of miRNA gene set evolution in nematodes, homologous gene families with conserved ‘dauer-infective’ expression signatures are present. These findings suggest that common post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are at work and that the same miRNA families play important roles in developmental arrest as well as long-term survival in free-living and parasitic nematodes. Overall design: miRNA profiling in mixed and developmentally arrested stages (dauer/infective larvae) of nematodes by small RNA deep sequencing using Illumina GAII, Illumina HiSeq 2000, and ABI SOLiD.

study_description=In this study, we present the first gene-expression profiling data for early larval stages of P. pacificus. In total, we have sequenced ten RNA libraries, that were collected throughout the development of P. pacificus. Comparing the transcriptome data to previous genomic studies of P. pacificus, we found that roughly 97% of predicted gene models are supported by RNA-seq data and that our data shows consistent trends when compared to microarray data. We characterized multi-gene family with predominantly stage-specific expression and used phylogenetic analyses to elucidate the role of gene duplications in the evolution of stage-specific expression within the Pristionchus lineage.
