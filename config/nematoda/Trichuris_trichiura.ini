study_description=we characterized the transcriptome of the adult stage of the human whipworm T. trichiura, using next-generation sequencing technology and a de novo assembly strategy. Nearly 17.6 million high-quality clean reads were assembled into 6,414 contiguous sequences. Total RNA was subjected to depletion of ribosomal RNA by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). Transcriptome sequencing was achieved using the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine™ (PGM) and the Ion 318™ chip. The raw reads were stored in FASTQ format; short reads (<50 nt) were removed and the remaining sequences were trimmed at both 5’ and 3’ ends. De novo assembly of the clean reads was generated with the MIRA 4.0 assembler.
