study_description=The Genome Institute and collaborators are sequencing the intestinal worm, Trichostrongylus colubriformis . One of the Trichostrongylids, it is an economically important gastrointestinal parasite of sheep, goats and other ruminants worldwide. Control of members of this genus has become difficult worldwide due to widespread drug resistance to all major classes of anthelmintic. This group has arguably been the subject of a substantial research effort on vaccine and diagnostic test development, control strategies, drug efficacy trials and drug resistance. Some species are important models of parasitism as well as important pathogens.   Trichostrongylus species are of major veterinary and economic importance, causing substantial production losses (through a reduction in weight gain, meat and/or milk production) to farmers and exacerbating the global food shortage problem. Of most importance are the parasites of grazing livestock, which cause significant economic problems to agriculture and detrimental effects on animal welfare. The trichostrongylid nematodes were ranked as a group (since they mainly occur as mixed infections) and were top of that list (i.e. considered to have a greater impact than any other disease of domestic animals). This group of parasites is also amongst the most economically important diseases of livestock in the developed world.
