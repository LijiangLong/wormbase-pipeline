study_description=The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans contains each of the broad classes of eukaryotic small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), endogenous small-interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs) and piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). To better understand the evolution of these regulatory RNAs, we deep sequenced small RNAs from C. elegans and three closely related nematodes: C. briggsae, C. remanei and C. brenneri. The results reveal a fluid landscape of small RNA pathways with essentially no conservation of individual sequences aside from a subset of miRNAs. We identified 52 miRNA families that are conserved in each of the four species as well as numerous miRNAs that are species specific or shared between only two or three species. Despite a lack of conservation of individual piRNAs and siRNAs many of the features of each pathway, including genomic distribution, are conserved. We show that in each species, 26G siRNAs trigger stage-specific secondary siRNA formation. We also observe that piRNAs trigger siRNA formation from targets containing up to three mismatches in each species. Finally, we show that nematodes produce two distinct sex-specific classes of piRNAs, suggesting different roles for piRNAs in male and female germlines. Overall design: Sequencing small RNAs from four Caenorhabditis species: C. elegans, C. briggsae, C. remanei and C. brenneri

study_title=Conservation of mRNA and protein expression during development of C. elegans
center_name=GEO
tax_id=6238
study_description=Spatiotemporal control of gene expression is crucial for development and subject to evolutionary changes. Although proteins are the final product of most genes, the developmental proteome of an animal has not yet been comprehensively defined, and the correlation between RNA and protein abundance during development is largely unknown. Here, we globally measured and compared protein and mRNA expression changes during the life cycle of the nematodes C. elegans and C. briggsae, separated by ~30 million years of evolution. We observed that developmental mRNA and protein changes were highly conserved, to a surprisingly similar degree, but poorly correlated within a species, suggesting important and widespread post-transcriptional regulation. Post-transcriptional control was particularly well conserved if mRNA fold changes were buffered on the protein level, indicating a predominant repressive function. Finally, among divergently expressed genes, we identified insulin signaling, a pathway involved in life span determination, as a putative target of adaptive evolution. Overall design: Samples of C. elegans and C. briggsae were collected at major developmental stages throughout the nematode life cycle. These stages comprise a population of mixed embryonic stages (E), populations of all four larval stages (L1, L2, L3, L4), late L4 larvae (LL4), young adults (YA), and a reference sample consisting of a mixture of all stages. To obtain synchronized worm populations, embryos were extracted by bleaching gravid adults and synchronized by starvation. Later stages were picked at fixed timepoints after determining the developmental stages by microscopic observation. For all stages, at least a single poly(A)-extracted mRNA library was sequenced on a single lane of an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx.

study_title=Developmental dynamics of C. elegans dosage compensation
center_name=GEO
tax_id=6238
study_description=In Caenorhabditis elegans, the dosage compensation complex (DCC) specifically binds to and represses transcription from both X chromosomes in hermaphrodites. The DCC is composed of an X-specific condensin complex that interacts with several proteins. During embryogenesis, DCC starts localizing to the X chromosomes around the 40-cell stage, and is followed by X-enrichment of H4K20me1 between 100-cell to comma stage. Here, we analyzed dosage compensation of the X chromosome between sexes, and the roles of dpy-27 (condensin subunit), dpy-21 (non-condensin DCC member), set-1 (H4K20 monomethylase) and set-4 (H4K20 di-/tri-methylase) in X chromosome repression using mRNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses across several developmental time points. We found that the DCC starts repressing the X chromosomes by the 40-cell stage, but X-linked transcript levels remain significantly higher in hermaphrodites compared to males through the comma stage of embryogenesis. Dpy-27 and dpy-21 are required for X chromosome repression throughout development, but particularly in early embryos dpy-27 and dpy-21 mutations produced distinct expression changes, suggesting a DCC independent role for dpy-21. We previously hypothesized that the DCC increases H4K20me1 by reducing set-4 activity on the X chromosomes. Accordingly, in the set-4 mutant, H4K20me1 increased more from the autosomes compared to the X, equalizing H4K20me1 level between X and autosomes. H4K20me1 increase on the autosomes led to a slight repression, resulting in a relative effect of X derepression. H4K20me1 depletion in the set-1 mutant showed greater X derepression compared to equalization of H4K20me1 levels between X and autosomes in the set-4 mutant, indicating that H4K20me1 level is important, but X to autosomal balance of H4K20me1 contributes only slightly to X-repression. Thus H4K20me1 by itself is not a downstream effector of the DCC. In summary, X chromosome dosage compensation starts in early embryos as the DCC localizes to the X, and is strengthened in later embryogenesis by H4K20me1. Overall design: RNA-Seq profiles of C. elegans wild type hermaphrodite, mixed sex, at 5 time points and dpy-27, set-4, dpy-21, set-1 and RNAi at 2-3 time points with 3-4 replicates each. RNA-Seq profiles of C. elegans. Strains are N2 (wild type), BS553 fog-2(oz40) V, CB428 dpy-21(e428) V, MK4 dpy-27(y56) III, MT14911 set-4 (n4600) II, SS1075 set-1(tm1821)/hT2g[bli-4(e937) let-?(q782) qIs48] (I;III). Set-1 collections made as heterozygotes and dpy-27(y56) homozygotes. Spike in RNA-seq libraries have AF16 wild type C. briggsae L1s added at a 1:10 ratio. Timepoints are early embryos (synchronized collection, <40 cells), comma embryos (synchronized early embryos aged for 4 hours), mixed embryos (mixed stage embryos from unsynchronized population), L1 (synchronized L1 larvae), L3 (synchronized L3 larvae), and YA (synchronized young adults, collected before embryos present in hermaphrodite gonad). Biological replicates for each strain/stage listed separately. ChIP-seq profiles of C. elegans DCC subunit dpy-27, H4K20me1 histone modification and RNA pol II large subunit ama-1 in 3-6 replicates from mixed stage (unsynchronized) embryos and synchronized L3 larvae. Corresponding inputs are labelled with "Input_" plus ChIP name.

study_description=This project defines the transcriptomes of XO (male) and XX (female or mutant pseudo-female) Caenorhabditis nematodes. The data allow the overall composition and sexual regulation of the transcriptome within a single species to be determined. In addition, the five related species studied allow meta-comparisons between them. Because two of the five (C. elegans and C. briggsae) produce a self-fertile XX hermaphrodite, while the XX sex in the remaining three (C. japonica, C. remanei, and C. brenneri) are true females, the data are particularly useful for inferring effects of sexual mode on genome-wide gene expression. Overall design: L4 larvae and adults were pooled for each sex for five species (C. elegans, C. briggsae, C. japonica, C. brenneri, and C. remanei).  Each of these 10 species-sex combinations was replicated three times, for a total of 30 samples.
