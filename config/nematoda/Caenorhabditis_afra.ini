study_description=DNA and RNA were isolated from Caenorhabditis afra at the Félix lab in Paris. Two genomic libraries of differing insert-size were prepared by Edinburgh Genomics and each was sequenced as paired-end using Illumina HiSeq 2500. A single PE run of RNA-seq data was also generated. Caenorhabditis afra genome sequencing is part of the collaborative Caenorhabditis Genomes Project. Edinburgh Genomics was carried out the sequencing using Illumina platforms.
