study_description=Strongyloides ratti is a common gastro-intestinal parasite of the rat. The adult parasites are female only, about 2mm long and live in the mucosa of the small intestine. These parasites produce eggs that pass out of the host in its faeces. In the environment infective larval stages develop either directly or after a facultative sexual free-living adult generation. Infective larvae infect hosts by skin penetration.S. ratti is the laboratory analogue of the parasite of humans, S. stercoralis. S. stercoralis is a wide-spread parasite of humans, occurring principally in the tropics and sub-tropics: some 100-200 million people are infected worldwide. Infection of immunosuppressed individuals can result in disseminated strongyloidiasis, in which worms occur throughout the body. This can be fatal unless anti-Strongyloides therapy is given. Other species of Strongyloides parasitise a wide range of vertebrates.  As part of the Strongyloides ratti genome project we are profiling the transcriptome of the parasite across its life cycle using RNA-Seq.. This data is part of a pre-publication release.

study_title=microRNAs in C. elegans, P. pacificus, and S. ratti: Conserved miRNAs are candidate post-transcriptional regulators of developmental arrest in free-living and parasitic nematodes
center_name=GEO
tax_id=34506
study_description=Animal development is complex yet surprisingly robust. Animals may develop alternative phenotypes conditional on environmental changes. Under unfavorable conditions C. elegans larvae enter the dauer stage, a developmentally arrested, long-lived, and stress-resistant state. Dauer larvae of free-living nematodes and infective larvae of parasitic nematodes share many traits including a conserved endocrine signaling module (DA/DAF-12), which is essential for the formation of dauer and infective larvae. We speculated that conserved post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism might also be involved in executing the dauer and infective larvae fate. We used an unbiased sequencing strategy to characterize the microRNA (miRNA) gene complement in C. elegans, P. pacificus, and S. ratti. Our study raised the number of described miRNA genes to 257 for C. elegans, tripled the known gene set for P. pacificus to 362 miRNAs and is the first to describe miRNAs in a Strongyloides parasite. Moreover, we found a limited core set of 24 conserved miRNA families in all three species. Interestingly, our estimated expression fold changes between dauer vs. non-dauer stages and infective larvae vs. free-living stages reveal that despite the speed of miRNA gene set evolution in nematodes, homologous gene families with conserved ‘dauer-infective’ expression signatures are present. These findings suggest that common post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are at work and that the same miRNA families play important roles in developmental arrest as well as long-term survival in free-living and parasitic nematodes. Overall design: miRNA profiling in mixed and developmentally arrested stages (dauer/infective larvae) of nematodes by small RNA deep sequencing using Illumina GAII, Illumina HiSeq 2000, and ABI SOLiD.

center_name=SC
tax_id=34506
study_description=The genus Strongyloides spp. include important human parasites. There is also a well studied rodent model, S. ratti. Uniquely among parasitic nematodes, the Strongyloides life-cycle includes both a parasitic female stage and a genetically identical free-living female stage. Differences between these two female forms must be epigenetic, presumably controlled by altered transcription and translation. This is a project to compare the proteome and transcriptome of the parasitic and free-living females of S. ratti. From this we will define the genes and gene products of the parasitic female stage. This approach exploits the currently advanced S. ratti genome sequencing project. This work will give an understanding of the molecular basis of nematode parasitism, and so define new potential drug targets.This data is part of a pre-publication release.
