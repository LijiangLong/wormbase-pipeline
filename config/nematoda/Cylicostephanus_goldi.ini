study_description=Here, we report next generation transcriptome sequencing analysis for the common cyathostomin species, Cylicostephanus goldi. RNA was extracted from 17 Cys. goldi male and female adult parasites.  Double stranded cDNA synthesis was carried out using the SMART approach, following by normalization of the sample, using the DSN normalization method (Evrogen).  Sequencing was carried out using a 454 GS FLX pyrosequencer, resulting in 475,215 sequencing reads being generated, which were assembled into 26,910 contigs.  Protein prediction and annotation was carried out using the prot4EST and annot8r software.  Using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases, 27% of the transcriptome was annotated.  Further annotation was carried out using KAAS and InterProScan web-based tools, in addition to comparative analysis with nematode transcriptome and genome datasets, specifically clade V nematodes, resulting in annotation of 51.2% of the predicted Cys. goldi proteins.
