study_description=DNA and RNA were isolated from Caenorhabditis sp. 40 strain JU2818. Two genomic libraries of differing insert-size were prepared by Edinburgh Genomics and each was sequenced  as paired-end using Illumina HiSeq 2500. A single PE run of RNA-seq data was also generated. Caenorhabditis sp. 40 genome sequencing is part of the collaborative Caenorhabditis Genomes Project. Edinburgh Genomics was carried out the sequencing using Illumina platforms.
