study_description=Note: we know there to be a significant amount of bacterial contamination and the genome appears to be highly heterozygous. Two genomic libraries of differing insert-size were prepared by Edinburgh Genomics and each was sequenced twice as paired-end using Illumina HiSeq 2500. Two PE runs of RNA-seq data were also generated Caenorhabditis guadeloupensis genome sequencing is part of the collaborative Caenorhabditis Genomes Project. Edinburgh Genomics was carried out the sequencing using Illumina platforms. Visit caenorhabditis.bio.ed.ac.uk to browse genome assemblies, download “cleaned” reads and find out more.
