1.) Fake Modules and Analysis
----------------------------------------
update the wormpipe stuff from subversion:
cd ~mh6/src/perl/ensembl/
svn co
rake deploy

the analysis table is populated from the analysis.conf file, which in turn provides the logic_name for the get_adaptor_by_logic_name .
So far i think the name is important, the rest is for the pipeline

rule.conf
make sure to remove all stuff you removed from analysis.conf

To fill the analysis_description table, the load_analysis_description needs to be run with an flatfile containing the descriptions.

2.) setup
----------------------
wormbase_to_ensembl setup

make sure WormBaseConf is correctly set and the ensembl-conf directory is existing with an proper analysis.conf
don't forget the hardcoded chromosome lengths in the WormBaseConf.pm

x.) Bugs & features
--------------------
Ensembl uses some DBI::mysql code that is not in line with the latest DBI::mysql :-(
Protein and Peptide is somehow used in no meaningful way for class names DnaPepAlignFeature BUT get_ProteinAlignFeatureAdaptor
BioPerl version is of course not the last one
