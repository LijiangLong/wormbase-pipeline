my $log_msg= <<'LOGMSG';
1) The following 12 clones are representative of the whole genome in that
they include one Sanger and one St. Louis clone for each chromosome.  Check
each clone to ensure that it contains BLAT data (EST and mRNA), BLAST data,
waba data, gene models, UTRs etc.  Also check for presence of tandem and inverted
repeats which have gone missing in the past

i)    C25A1
ii)   F56A3
iii)  C04H5
iv)   B0432
v)    C07A9
vi)   F30H5
vii)  C10C6
viii) B0545
ix)   C12D8
x)    K04F1
xi)   C02C6
xii)  AH9

2) If the genome sequence has changed, you should inspect the clones containing
those changes to see if there are any strange errors (e.g. duplicate sets of data
which are slightly out of sync.)

3) Check ~wormpub/BUILD/autoace/CHROMOSOMES/composition.all - are there any non-ATCGN
characters

4a) Check that the latest WormPep proteins have proper protein and motif homologies
This has been a problem in some builds where all new WormPep proteins have not got any
BLAST analyses.  Pick a few random Wormpep proteins and especially check that all of
the various blastp homologies are there (human, fly, worm, yeast etc.) and try to
check at least one protein from the ~wormpub/BUILD/WORMPEP/wormpepXXX/new_entries.WSXXX file

4b) Now that we have a curated set of brigpep, should do this periodically for
C. briggase protein objects too...these now have their own set of blastp hits

5) Check PFAM Motif objects have a title tag. It is a problem if there are more than about 20.

6) Run: 
  ls ~wormpub/BUILD/autoace/CHROMOSOMES/*.dna | grep -v masked |grep -v Mt| xargs composition
Make sure this is the same as it was at the start of the build:
  cat ~wormpub/BUILD/autoace/CHROMOSOMES/composition.all
Bad Homol objects can lead to errors esp when chromosome length has been reduced

Thats all...for now!  If you are satisfied the build is ok, please inform the person
building the database. Please continue to add to this list as appropriate.

This script simply sends a list of check items to the next person doing the build.
They should 'sign off' on each build and hand back to the main person when they
are happy all is ok.

=item MANDATORY arguments: -user <valid unix username>

Needed to send email
