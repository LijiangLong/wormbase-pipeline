Changes to new CDS class
------------------------

1) Added 'S_child PCR_product...' to CDS class.  All S_child's had previously not been instated into this
class, but Marc Vidal PCR_product objects reflect amplification from a cDNA clone and so represent an object
attached to a Predicted_gene/CDS object rather than to the parent sequence.


2) Added 'Confirmed_by #Gene_confirmation' to CDS class as it was missing, presumably CDS objects will
want to contain this information to indicate whether the object has complete EST/mRNA coverage? I have 
left this line in the Sequence model, but don't really see that it needed to be left there...if predicted
genes are moved into the CDS class, what would be left in the Sequence class that would need 'Confirmed_by'
information?

3) RNAi class had a line which was 'Inhibits Predicted_gene ?Sequence XREF RNAi_result'.  However, as the
Predicted_gene subclass has now replaced by the CDS class, this should be reflected in the RNAi model,
i.e.

Inhibits	Predicted_gene ?CDS XREF RNAi_result 
		Gene ?Gene   XREF RNAi_result

The corresponding line for the CDS class 'RNAi_result ?RNAi XREF Predicted_gene' already existed and
doesn't need to be added.  I'm not sure if there is still a need to retain the above line in the Sequence
class (where it originally was before being copied into the CDS class).  Will an RNAi result be attached
to a Sequence which isn't a CDS/Predicted_gene?


4) Added new operon class model from Dan, linked this to CDS class rather than Sequence class though. I.e.
in the Operon model there is:

Contains_CDS ?CDS XREF Contained_in_operon

This could potentially be expanded to also have something like:

Contains_genes ?Gene XREF Contained_in operon

Not sure if it gets too confusing to have double links from CDS *and* Gene objects to another object though.


5) Added the following to CDS class:

DB_info Protein_id ?Sequence UNIQUE Text UNIQUE Int // DB_info tag added [011030 krb]
	DB_remark ?Text

This seems to be needed for CDS objects as many predicted gene objects currently contain these tags.



6) Added 'Reference ?Paper XREF CDS' to CDS class (and also added corresponding line in Paper
class).  This is because many current Predicted_genes refer to Papers.



7) Added Annotation subtree to CDS class, i.e.	

Annotation SwissProt_DE	UNIQUE	Text
	   EC_number	Text

Again because this is used by Predicted_genes.  There is no use for the Pfam tag though as it is not currently
used.
