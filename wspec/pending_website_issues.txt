14th April, 2004
?3d_data - new class, not picked up on website at all
?Y2H - another new class, not picked up on website at all

?SAGE_transcript & ?SAGE_tag - both have new 'Most_three_prime' tag

23rd April, 2004
Two new methods for "predicted_polyA_site" and "predicted_polyA_signal_sequence"
Will go in for WS124.

26th April, 2004
New connection between Locus and Allele classes for horrible SNP objects, Locus class has Allele
tag which XREFs to a Locus tag in the Allele classs

28th April, 2004
Added Gene tag to Balancer hash

14th May, 2004
Added new event option in Gene_history_action hash.  Genes can now have 'Changed_class' tag set should they change from (say) a CDS to a Pseudogene.

14th May, 2004
Removed UNIQUE qualifer for Corresponding_transcript tag in CDS class, so that CDS objects can now connect to multiple
transcripts


14th May, 2004
RNA tag in Sequence class now has new set subtags to categorise what type of RNA it is,
this is for RNA sequences that come in via EMBL/GenBank, not for our own Transcript objects


14th May, 2004
New Method for BLATTING non-coding RNA sequences against genome...previously these were (mistakenly)
included as part of BLAT_mRNA_BEST and BLAT_mRNA_OTHER, these will now be BLAT_ncRNA_BEST and BLAT_ncRNA_OTHER
New tracks needed???  These will have GFF_feature 'nucleotide_match'

1st June, 2004
Fixed bug in PCR product model, which was not linking to Transcript class properly

2nd June, 2004
Added Isoform tag to ?Pseudogene model

30th June, 2004
Added SO_term model to handle SOFA terms (a la GO_term) and possibly link
to Feature objects (as a starting point)

Operon model now contains Genes rather than CDSs

New gene history action event of 'Made_into_transposon'

Gene objects now have an SMapped extent on to Sequence objects


23rd July
CDS, Transcript, and Gene tags in Gene class now become Corresponding_XXX tags

New Library class to support new data on nematode EST consensi (from Blaxter group in Edinburgh)
EST sequence objects (non-C.elegans) will now link to Library class via Library tag, and those
consensus sequences will have a EST_consensus tag (those part of a consensus will have a 
Contained_in_cluster tag which XREFs to a Contains_reads tag)



9th August
Gene_regulation now links to ?Antibody class via Antibody_info tag and ?Transgene via Transgene
tag.

Added 'Particle_bombardment' tag to Transgene class (under Isolation tag)


Paper class loses Medline_acc tag and uses PMID tag in a new way (now xrefd to Paper_name class)


31st August 2004
Model clean-up to remove unused tags:
PMID_evidence tag removed from Evidence hash
Qualifier tag removed from ?Allele
Reference_allele tag removed from ?Allele

?UTR class removed

Added 'Landmark_gene' tag to Gene class (under Map tag) to flag those genes which will
appear on the genetic map dispay part of Genome Browser


17th September
--------------
Added Ortholog tag to Gene class which links to other ?Gene objects, removed unused Ortholog tag from ?CDS

Three new tags (Predicted, Partially_confirmed, Confirmed) in ?CDS class to replace the existing
Confirmed_by tag which is now removed along with the #Gene_confirmation.

GFF_feature field in ?Method now links to ?SO_term rather than Text.  This *shouldn't* have any impact
on the website but I guess you never know!  This is taking advantage of a new acedb feature.

Expr_pattern class gets new GO_term tag to link to ?GO_term and each tag under the 'Expressed_in' tag make
use of a new hash.


21st October 2004
-----------------
Added History_name tag to ?RNAi model to store old names before we change object names to WBRNAi....

Major update to ?Feature model, some changed tag name (Sequence_features is no more) and lots of new
tags to take account of.

New Interaction model for Andrei's gene interaction data...Need to ideally pick up the new Interaction tag in 
the Gene class to see when there is interaction data.



19th November 2004
------------------

Removed CGC_approved tag from ?Gene_class as it is redundant.  Hope nothing on the web uses this.


Added #Evidence hash after CGC_name tag in ?Gene...this will be populated in the near future

New Pseudo_map_position tag in ?Gene model - don't think website needs to do anything with this unless
you want to flag those genes which have an artificial map position.

Revamped ?RNAi class, no longer SMapped to sequence or PCR_product but uses Homol_data class.  Not
sure how the website uses RNAi data...but I assume that something will change somewhere as a result
of this new model

2nd February 2005
=================

?Variation class is here. Major changes to how SNPs/alleles etc are represented in the database.

Added tags to the #Evidence hash for other types of data.

Added new tags to the ?Gene class for Caltech descriptions. This required the collation of all description
tags under the Structured_description heading.

Added Title and Description tags to the ?Gene_cluster and ?Transposon_family classes.
