?3d_data - new class, not picked up on website at all
?Y2H - another new class, not picked up on website at all

?SAGE_transcript & ?SAGE_tag - both have new 'Most_three_prime' tag

23rd April, 2004
Two new methods for "predicted_polyA_site" and "predicted_polyA_signal_sequence"
Will go in for WS124.

26th April, 2004
New connection between Locus and Allele classes for horrible SNP objects, Locus class has Allele
tag which XREFs to a Locus tag in the Allele classs

28th April, 2004
Added Gene tag to Balancer hash

14th May, 2004
Added new event option in Gene_history_action hash.  Genes can now have 'Changed_class' tag set should they change from (say) a CDS to a Pseudogene.

14th May, 2004
Removed UNIQUE qualifer for Corresponding_transcript tag in CDS class, so that CDS objects can now connect to multiple
transcripts


14th May, 2004
RNA tag in Sequence class now has new set subtags to categorise what type of RNA it is,
this is for RNA sequences that come in via EMBL/GenBank, not for our own Transcript objects


14th May, 2004
New Method for BLATTING non-coding RNA sequences against genome...previously these were (mistakenly)
included as part of BLAT_mRNA_BEST and BLAT_mRNA_OTHER, these will now be BLAT_ncRNA_BEST and BLAT_ncRNA_OTHER
New tracks needed???  These will have GFF_feature 'nucleotide_match'

1st June, 2004
Fixed bug in PCR product model, which was not linking to Transcript class properly

2nd June, 2004
Added Isoform tag to ?Pseudogene model

30th June, 2004
Added SO_term model to handle SOFA terms (a la GO_term) and possibly link
to Feature objects (as a starting point)

Operon model now contains Genes rather than CDSs

New gene history action event of 'Made_into_transposon'

Gene objects now have an SMapped extent on to Sequence objects


23rd July
CDS, Transcript, and Gene tags in Gene class now become Corresponding_XXX tags

New Library class to support new data on nematode EST consensi (from Blaxter group in Edinburgh)
EST sequence objects (non-C.elegans) will now link to Library class via Library tag, and those
consensus sequences will have a EST_consensus tag (those part of a consensus will have a 
Contained_in_cluster tag which XREFs to a Contains_reads tag)



9th August
Gene_regulation now links to ?Antibody class via Antibody_info tag and ?Transgene via Transgene
tag.

Added 'Particle_bombardment' tag to Transgene class (under Isolation tag)


Paper class loses Medline_acc tag and uses PMID tag in a new way (now xrefd to Paper_name class)


31st August 2004
Model clean-up to remove unused tags:
PMID_evidence tag removed from Evidence hash
Qualifier tag removed from ?Allele
Reference_allele tag removed from ?Allele

?UTR class removed

Added 'Landmark_gene' tag to Gene class (under Map tag) to flag those genes which will
appear on the genetic map dispay part of Genome Browser
